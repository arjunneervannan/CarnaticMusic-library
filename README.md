# CarnaticMusic-library

The purpose of this project is to collate various sources of Carnatic (South Indian classical music) and organize them in an easy-to-use app.

Current libraries of Carnatic music include Sangeethapriya, Youtube, and others. While these have large collections of music, it is often uncurated and difficult to search. A new easy-to-use application is needed.

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Sources of music

### SangeethaPriya
Sangeethapriya contains one of the biggest and most vast collections of music. The python file sangeethapriya.py scrapes the SangeethaPriya website.
